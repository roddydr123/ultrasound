Takes in measurements made with the EPP
Interpolates them to make a denser array of values
Integrates to find the area under that curve
Uses a minimization to find a line which bisects this area. It works by varying 
the y coordinate of a point which when evaluated with the origin form a line.
THIS MINIMIZATION DOES NOT WORK 
The result of this is then used to find the coordinates of a rectangle with the
same area as that under the curve.
